# MyMobile Telecom Database Project

Relational database project modeling a fictional telecom company. Includes schema design, sample data, and SQL queries to answer key business questions.

## Introduction

This project provides a complete database design and implementation for *MyMobile*, a fictional telecommunications provider. The relational schema, built in MySQL, manages customer information, service plans, transactions, cancellations, and call traffic. Scripts are included to create the schema, populate it with sample data, and run analytic queries that support core business processes.

## Key Features

**Comprehensive Database Schema**
A fully normalized relational schema that manages customers, plans, transactions, cancellations, and call traffic.

**Sample Data Population**
Scripts to load test data for multiple customers and plans, including transactions, cancellations, and call logs.

**Business Reports**
SQL queries that generate three core reports used to analyze operations:
- **Customer Summary** showing all plans and cancellations for each customer
- **Customer Call Log** with call date, duration, type, and cost
- **Plan Revenue Report** calculating total revenue per plan

## Database Design

The database was designed to capture the key business processes of MyMobile by modeling the relationships between customers, plans, transactions, and call traffic. The final Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is shown below.

This project is an original solution to the “MyMobile” case study, which was provided as part of the CSPB 3287 course curriculum. All database design, SQL scripts, and analysis are original work.
